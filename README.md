# User Management Service

---

## Description
The User Management Service is a microservice designed to handle user-related operations within a larger system. It provides functionality for user authentication, authorization, profile management, and user-related data manipulation.

## Features
1. **User Authentication:** Allows users to securely authenticate themselves using various methods such as username/password, OAuth, or JWT tokens.
2. **User Authorization:** Manages user roles and permissions to control access to different parts of the system.
3. **Profile Management:** Enables users to update their profiles, including personal information, contact details, and preferences.
4. **User Data Manipulation:** Provides CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for user data, allowing administrators to manage user accounts efficiently.

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot:** Provides a robust framework for building microservices with ease, offering features like dependency injection, auto-configuration, and embedded servers.
- **Spring Security:** Ensures the security of the User Management Service by implementing authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **PostgreSQL:** A powerful open-source relational database used to store user-related data securely.
- **Docker:** Facilitates containerization of the microservice, making it easy to deploy and manage across different environments.
- **Maven:** Manages project dependencies and facilitates building, testing, and packaging the microservice.
- **Kafka:** Provides a distributed event streaming platform that enables communication between microservices in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner.
